In regression one value is given and we have to find the other value using regression line ( just like we find y using y=mx+c )

to find the regression line 
y-Ybar=byx(x-Xbar) // byx=r dely/del x
on the basis of given values if we can find the regression line equation then we can easily find the other value by putting the given value 
regression line equation will be different for differnt given values 
y on x means we know x we have to find y

CORRELATION IS DIFFERNENT THAN CORRELATION IN CORRELATION WE HAVE TO FIND THE RELATION AND BOTH THE VALUE IS GIVEN

steps to predict current year sell from previous year sell: (USING SIMPLE LINEAR REGRESSION ANALYSIS)
1) we have to find is there any relationship forming between dependent and independent variable (correlation btwn last year of experience and last sell)
2) now we have to check for regression to get slope and constant of the line of best fit , and with the help of this line we will predict the current year sell
